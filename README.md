2022 Annual report for Lakeside Store

Using MS Excel, I have created the annual report for the Lakeside Store where we get to see the sales trends observed in 2022. The insights drawn from the the report would help the company to further grow their business in 2023.

Data Cleaning: Before the data can be analyzed, the data needs to be validated. The below checks were performed:
	1. Duplicate values should not be present in fields - Index, Customer ID and Order ID.
	2. Ensure to have correct data type for each column. Example - Date type for field Date.

Data Processing: Certain fields contained inaccurate format of data that had to be processed before the data could be manipulated.
	1. The filed Gender contained 4 values: M, W, Men and Women. The values M & W were converted to Men and Women, respectively.
	2. The field Qty contained vlaues in the form of text such as One and Two which were converted to 1 & 2 respectively.
	3. I added a new column called Age Group which would help the business to understand the sales trend with respect to customer's age. I created 3 age groups -            Senior is >= 50, Adult is >= 25 and Young adults are > 15 years of age.
	4. The month was extracted for each order placed which would help determine the trends for monthly sales.

Data Manipulation and Analysis: With the help of pivot tables and pivot charts, I was able to derive the insights mentioned in the below sections.
